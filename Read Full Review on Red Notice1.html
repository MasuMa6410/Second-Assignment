    <h1>Now you can have access on the complete review of this movie.</h1>
    <p>I'd just like to start with the statement, John Hartley (played by Dwayne Johnson) becomes past tense at about the 2/3 Mark of the movie, something I feel is unfortunately overlooked by the script. THIS IS NOT A SPOILER OR PART OF THE SCRIPT BUT INSTEAD MY PERSONAL TAKE ON EVENTS 
        Notice is one of my favorite movies ... so well done, full of action, good plot, such funny sequences, and an amazing performance of the actors ...
       The director of Rawson Marshall is doing an amazing job, a very good director who knows what he's doing!
       The film starts with Gal Gadot, Ryan Reynolds, Dwayne Johnson, Ritu Arya, Chris Diamantopoulos ...
       Gal Gadot is a beautiful and talented actress, I can't believe how good she looks in this movie, Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne Johnson do an amazing job together, they are by far the best part of the movie ... Ritu Arya and Chris Diamantopoulos Although they don't play such an important role in the movie, they are very good at what they do, and you really don't feel they are stuffing, again very nice and good actors.
       The story is one of my favorites, it's a fictional story about Cleopatra's three eggs. John Hartley, an "FBI agent" wants to catch the world's greatest art thief, Nolan Booth, with information from The Bishop/Sarah Black...as the story progresses it takes a bunch of twists.
       I have to add that my favorite character is Nolan Booth, played by Ryan Reynolds ... he has his signature, I love him when he talks like a broken doll. I actually love every character he plays, he's a very good actor who doesn't feel like he's playing a role, he's himself
       Iâ€™d actually be up to seeing a sequel to be honest

       Another film where DJ, RR and GG all play themselves.
       
       We get a good of glimpse of The Rock in a jungle which is something I don't think anyone has ever seen before.
       
       Sometimes being "the hardest worker in the room" just means playing the same character again and again.
       
       The saving grace of this movie has to be Ryan Reynolds playing the same, quick-witted fast talking character.
       
       Gal Gadot was quite good.
       
       Not much screen time as I was expecting but that was just an added bonus.
