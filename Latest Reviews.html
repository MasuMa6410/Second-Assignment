    <h3>Five Feet Apart (movie)</h3>

     <article>I'm a 35 year old with CF. I was excited about this movie because any representation is potentially great. But I've seen other CF movies, seen it on TV, and it's usually terribly done. Incorrect nonsense, people are on o2 but climbing hills like it's no big deal, the severity isn't properly shown, etc...</article>

    <h3>Happiness (series)</h3>

     <article>This 12 episode series is the first that brilliantly takes elements of the pandemic to create a thriller that feels totally relatable. Because of what everyone has been through this past 2 years many elements of this show don't feel far fetched but instead are gripping and real.

    <h3>Red Notice 1 (movie)</h3>
    <img src="red notice1.jpg" alt="Red Notice">
     <article>I all honesty, the film isn't that bad - it's just something that's been so over-hyped from marketing it was a disappointment to watch.

        The film has smashed Netflix records for viewership but I think that's thanks to the marketing teams of all three major stars and the limitless budgets from Netflix.
        
        The film is very generic and follows a format most viewers are familiar with yet are told "it's something never been done before" and "totally unexpected" etc.
        
        I can't imagine this is a film you would want to sit down to watch once or twice a year but more something that'll be played on ITV2 at Christmas or a Bank Holiday.
