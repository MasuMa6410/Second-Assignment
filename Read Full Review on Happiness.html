    <h1>Now you can have access on the complete review of this series.</h1>
    <p>This 12 episode series is the first that brilliantly takes elements of the pandemic to create a thriller that feels totally relatable. Because of what everyone has been through this past 2 years many elements of this show don't feel far fetched but instead are gripping and real. One of the best things about the show is it doesn't rely on a lot of gore or shock tactics or a monster a minute kind of thing. Korean Tv and movies are great at doing zombies but here it's a rabies like disease with some zombie traits. The story builds up the different characters well so each encounter is meaningful and then when the excitement and scary moments happen it really counts. Love the selfish "villians" of the show like the doctor, the lawyer, the greedy woman and the president of the residents committee, and the cleaners all told with brilliant black comedy. The ending is feel good and brings together everything in a complete theatrical hilarious and logical way.

        The 2 leads are extremely likable. Han Hyo Joo is pretty and feisty. Park Hyung Shik has filled out and looks more mature now so he can do this kind of role. The supporting cast are excellent and they portray the quirks selfishness and greed of their characters in a hilarious and Parasite like way.
        
        Just watch it. The best show to emerge from the Pandemic.
